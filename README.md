## Why

In 10 years' time, all the content and art on the internet, every piece, will be a piece of cryptomedia. Some creators and artists will make a full-time career out of it, make millions and become celebrities in a new world of creation. Others will make a hobby of it and earn enough to live a good and happy life expressing their creativity. There are many different scenarios, but the one constant is that we will have a mountain of cryptomedia. Contextualizing and profiling the main pieces is crucial (and fun) to do as we are inundated with great creations over the next few years. It's crucial for us to create a behavior of thinking carefully, "chewing" and "digesting" the media (and its microcosm) that people are having access to. Moving beyond consumer behavior to "small-expert" or "fan polymath" behavior.

LongHouse is an attempt to provide a platform for anyone with a bit of spare time to **DAE** any NFT or collection of NFTs.

### Wtf is "DAE"?

#### D (dissect)

Cut out and highlight individual parts of the piece or specific tokens from a collection that you want to focus on during your anatomization
	
#### A (anatomize)

Examine and analyze the entire work (or dissected parts) to understand symbols, concepts, arguments, references and inspirations, possible hidden and underlying ideas, the relationship and interactions with the cultural/political/current landscape. 
	
#### E (enrich)

Add any kind of extra information (images, videos, messages, audios, links, links to other cryptomedia, comments) that you think could enrich the context of that piece (or part dissected) and make its microcosm more lively and populated.

Medieval bestiaries are a small source of inspiration for this project. And yes, I know, it's a strange inspiration.
